        In the laboratories of the Institute of Geology of the large quantity of numerical arrays resulting set of experiments to study these processes in the world. These data sets need to be careful and deep-cal mathematics and statistical analysis to identify the most susche-governmental factors that depend on those or other processes taking place in the earth and atmosphere. Now scientists OMI most actively involved in research directly related to these tasks. We (mathematics) is currently studying the relevant literature sources where such problems were investigated for other regions of the world. We are engaged in the search for the most appropriate mathematical models describing the relevant geological and atmospheric processes involved in computer modeling of these processes. The results of our research, performed in collaboration with scientists from the Institute of Geology, will soon be published. This work is not easy and requires us not only a huge routine work, but also a creative approach to solving these applications involving new co-temporal mathematical ideas developed by scientists OMI. In particular, these include methods for approximating discrete functions convent-rows in orthogonal systems, intensively studied in OMI's in recent years and the relevant software packages.

        Together with the Institute of Social and Economic Research SMI is looking for mathematical models that adequately describe the processes in various sectors of economy of Dagestan, as well as models for predicting the ways of sustainable development of the economy of individual regions of Dagestan and the whole of Dagestan as a whole.

        Scientists OMI DSC RAS ​​actively engaged in mathematical linguistics. Here, the greatest interest is in our creation of electronic dictionaries. On a weekly (on Thursdays) Research Seminar OMI DSC RAS ​​regularly discussed issues relating to the creation of electronic dictionaries Dagestan languages. We are deeply convinced impressive scientific results can be achieved in this way. The fact is that, to our knowledge, has not yet created any Russian-Dagestani electronic dictionary. We are not talking about English-Dagestani electronic dictionaries. In connection with this growing urgent need for close cooperation between the Institute of Language and Literature (IYALI) DSC RAS ​​and OMI DSC RAS. We need to create a joint research workshop where scientists and IYALI OMI will discuss modern methods of creating electronic dictionaries and their application to create a Russian-Dagestani and foreign-Dagestani electronic dictionaries. In addition, scientists and OMI IYALI could cooperate in a number of other areas related to the development of mathematical and computer models of the processes that are associated with the development of language, their syntax and semantics.

        Scientists OMI DSC RAS ​​conduct intensive research in the field of signal processing. We have no doubt that we have developed in this field, new methods will find practical application in matters of weather forecasting, medical signal processing (ECG) data obtained in experimental studies of geologists, biologists, economists and others. In particular, we have developed new methods of identification of parameters of stationary economic systems based on the use of orthogonal polynomials on uniform grids. OMI Graduate students are currently involved in the development of software packages for numerical implementation of these methods in practice.
